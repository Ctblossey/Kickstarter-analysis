# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project is to lay out different aspects of the Kickstarter challenge such as name, blurb, goal, pledge, etc. From here, we have a concrete way of keeping track of progress and making predictions. It is important to have a clean layout of all the data in order to make assumptions about which ones are successful and which are not. We have 4113 projects across several different categories and subcategories.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    - Based on the data we have, we are able to take a deep dive into the outcomes we have based on Launch Date. The analysis is comprised of a distribution of outcome types corresponding to their Launch Date months.
